There are several files under the "/"file.
But most of them are connected to system, if you login first, we will enter /home/.
<ls -l> option will show the directories under the / file.
bin/ boot/ dev/ etc/ home/ media/ tmp/ mnt/ sbin/ sys/ usr/ var/
every file has their own function.
But it will be hard to memorize them from the start.
As we use them more and more, they will come into memory naturally.
