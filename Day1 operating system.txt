#CentOS
#Between CentOS and Ubuntu, I considered a lot.
#Since CentOS is used in most of company's server and it's supported by RedHat, it would be fine to study CentOS.
#Ubuntu has an amount of users whole around the world, but there are no support since the problem happened.
#There are no large difference between them, just some command word differences.
#For example, Ubuntu uses apt, CentOS uses yum. It's also the difference between RedHat and Debian series.
#Above all, these are the reasons why I choose to study CentOS rather than Ubuntu.
#Hello, world.
