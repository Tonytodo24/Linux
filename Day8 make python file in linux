First of all, come to /home pwd.
through the code <...$mkdir python>
then a directory 'python' will be made.
<cd python> means change diectory to 'python', it's just been made before.
so it will show as <...@python$ >
then make a python file.
<...@python$ touch new.py>
file 'new.py' is made.
<...@python$ vi new.py>
you will enter a file with blank.
you can insert python code in that file such as <print('Hello, world!')>
save by <:wq>, it will come out autometically.
run python code which you just made by code <...@python$ python3 new.py>
then the code result 'Hello,world!' will show on linux terminal screen.
